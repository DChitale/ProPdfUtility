            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: [Current Date]</strong></p>

            <p>Pro PDF Utility ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website and its associated PDF tools (collectively, the "Service").</p>

            <section>
                <h3>1. No Data Collection or Transmission</h3>
                <p>The core principle of Pro PDF Utility is that <strong>all PDF processing is performed entirely on your local device (client-side) within your web browser.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We <strong>do not</strong> upload your PDF files or any data contained within them to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                    <li>We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information or content from the files you process.</li>
                    <li>Your files remain on your computer and are never seen by us.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>2. Information Handled Locally</h3>
                <p>The Service uses JavaScript code and browser APIs to manipulate PDF files directly in your browser. This includes operations like merging, splitting, compressing, watermarking, etc. All such operations are self-contained within your browser session.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>3. Local Storage for Preferences</h3>
                <p>We may use your browser's local storage to save your preferences, such as your choice of theme (e.g., dark mode). This information is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>4. Cookies</h3>
                <p>Pro PDF Utility does not use cookies for tracking or advertising purposes. Any cookies used would be strictly functional for site operation if necessary (e.g., session management for hypothetical future features, though not currently implemented for core tools).</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>5. Third-Party Libraries</h3>
                <p>The Service utilizes client-side JavaScript libraries such as PDF-Lib.js and PDF.js to provide its functionality. These libraries operate within your browser and are subject to their own licenses. We have chosen these libraries for their ability to perform operations client-side without external data transmission for core processing.</p>
                 <p>Links to external resources like CDNs for these libraries mean your browser will request these files from those CDNs. This is standard web practice and subject to the privacy policies of those CDN providers (e.g., unpkg.com, cdnjs.com).</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>6. Security</h3>
                <p>Since your files are not uploaded, the primary security concern is the security of your own device and browser. We recommend keeping your browser and operating system updated.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
